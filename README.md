# Crypto Portfolio Tracker


This was a collaborative project built with Java, React, and uses AWS.

Bcrypt was used for handling password hashing and JWT for authentication. Dagger was implemented for dependency injection and JUnit and Mockito for unit testing. 

AWS DynamoDB was used for data management, Lambda for serverless management, API Gateway for RESTful API endpoints, and S3 for storage.

Reusable components were implemented for better management and hooks to manage state. React router handles private and public routes for login and JWT for authentication and session storage.

Chart.js was used to build a doughnut chart with custom labels for data visualization and Axiox for HTTP client requests to API endpoints.
